## üìå Dataset Description

**AdvT-shirt-1K** is an adversarial patch dataset created for evaluating the robustness of YOLOv5s object detection models in physical-world environments. By attaching adversarial patches to the surface of T-shirts, this dataset simulates real-world evasion attack scenarios, providing researchers with an abundant collection of test samples and a benchmarking environment.

The physical patches are generated using our proposed method, **DiffPatch**, which is a diffusion-based adversarial patch generation method that allows customizable adversarial patches of various shapes and styles (based on reference images and masks), balancing attack performance and natural appearance.

Using **DiffPatch**, we designed **9 adversarial patches** and printed them on T-shirts. We recruited **20 participants** (with ethics approval) to capture images in diverse indoor and outdoor, including laboratories, campus, cafeteria, subway station, and shopping mall. In total, we collected **1,131 images** into **AdvT-shirt-1K** dataset, including both individual and group (2 to 10+ persons) photos. The dataset is accompanied with detailed annotations of the person and patch locations (bounding boxes). Our dataset provides a valuable resource for advancing defense research against adversarial patch attacks.

## üéØ Key Features

* **Innovative Approach**: The dataset uniquely combines adversarial attacks with physical environments by applying adversarial patches to T-shirt surfaces, making it an effective tool for testing object detection models' resistance to evasion in real-world settings.
* **Diverse Scenarios**: It includes a variety of shooting conditions, lighting, backgrounds, angles, and movement states.
* **Real-world Context**: Designed to simulate dynamic wear and different environmental conditions, providing valuable insights into how adversarial attacks can affect detection accuracy.

## üìÇ Dataset Contents

1. **Image Data**

* Contains images of subjects wearing adversarial T-shirts.
* Varied environments: indoor (laboratories, subway station), outdoor (sunlight, campus, shopping mall).
* Including both individual and group (2 to 10+ persons) photos, stored in different folders.

2. **Annotation Files**

* YOLO-style annotation format for object detection.
